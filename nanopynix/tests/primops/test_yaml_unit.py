"""Direct unit tests for nanopynix.primops.yaml.

The only existing coverage goes through real worker RPC round-trips in
nanopynix/tests/rpc/client/test_eval_rpc.py, which the module's own docstring
notes is broken on Nix 2.31. These dumb coverage tests exercise the pure
Python parsing/rendering logic directly so it stays covered regardless of
that upstream primop-registration issue.
